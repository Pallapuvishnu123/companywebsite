        <blockquote>I’ve been practicing yoga for a while now and I can definitely observe noticeable differences in my
          body – I gained so much flexibility and strength! It’s challenging, but through the clear instructions and
          consistency of the trainings I can feel great results. Deepraj is very professional and brings a very positive
          energy to the class and motivates you to put that extra effort. Not just fitness/Dance he's multi talented and
          I have joined Music classes as well without any prior experience and the journey so far is amazing and with
          each classes I have gained more confidence in singing and I highly recommend his classes to all people who are
          really serious in learning any form of arts.</blockquote>

        <p>"I enrolled my daughter for keyboard and Carnatic singing classes. Mr. Deep Raj is an excellent music
          teacher. He’s trained in both Carnatic and western music and is also a multi-instrumentalist. He’s
          enthusiastic, talented, knowledgable, polite and friendly. The recitals are excellent, showcasing all ages and
          skill levels in a warm and friendly environment. Individual attention is given equally for keyboard lessons as
          well. My daughter has learned lots of music over the last few months. The school has flexible timings and
          nominal fees. I highly recommend this music school for learning music or improving your music skills at any
          level."</p>
